# GhostPB

The notion of a PB (personal best) in timed sports is that you are constantly trying to improve your own time,
effectively being in a mental race against yourself. 

GhostPB allows users to track and time their runs using google maps API, and save them to the app so that they can "race" against
themselves at a later date. The app will prompt the user if they are beating or losing to previous trials of the same track.
