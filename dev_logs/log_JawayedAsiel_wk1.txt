Spent 2 hours reading and making sense of code.
Spent 30 mins trying to figure out why I couldn't git clone this repo. Figured out it was because of the template log file I left in xd
(Does that count as time towards the project?)
Spent an hour working on an icon for the app.
Spent an hour changing the array so that it dynamically resizes itself instead of it being static.
