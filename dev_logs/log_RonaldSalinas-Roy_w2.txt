1.5 hours:
	Debugging a crash issue that was happening on emulators when switching activities. Cause determined to be from 	
  the string array parameter in the Adapter. Brainstormed changes.
2.5 hours:
	Studied the code further. Looked on how to fix little errors and thought about any needs for error handling.
  Studied switches.
	Translated functions to make use of event listeners.
	Tidied up some code.
	Replaced repetitive use of string literals with variables, and made use of XML string resources.
	Some commenting.
