4 hours:
  Changed time format in the displayAvailableRoutesActivity from MM:SS to HH:MM:SS:mSmSmS.
  Put a character limit of 15 on the display of route names. Was unable to get InputFilter working on the EditTexts
  Formatted the appearance of the cells within the displayAvailableRoutesActivity to have the time be located underneath the name
  Encountered issues in trying to make displaying the name with the time prettier, as alignment was difficult from what I believe to be the width of characters. Tried various ways to figure out how I should get the spacing between the name and time. Some of these ways make use of: StringBuilder, String.Format, strings built through for loops
