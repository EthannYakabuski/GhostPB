7 hours:
  Minor touches in visual design.
	Implemented intents being passed between MapsActivity and displayAvailableRoutesActivity. Had to rework code in    	
  both activities	and learn about Parcelables.
	In displayAvailableRoutesActivity:
		- Buttons for route selection, deletion, renaming, and going back. Decided to make these buttons 
      for more explicit functionality. Did consider swipe operations, but that functionality may could go unnoticed 
		- Each button has click event listeners, and their affect on content is also shown in the intent 
		- Adjusted ListView attributes and constraints
		- Added an event listener for the ConstraintLayout to help determine when an item in the listview is deselected 
		- Dialog pop ups for delete and rename click events 
		- Other minor touches
